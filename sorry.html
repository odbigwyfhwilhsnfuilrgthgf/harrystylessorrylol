            <h2>POV:</h2>
            <p>You are backstage at the O2 Arena holding a tray of chicken nuggets. Suddenly, you trip over a stray power cord.
"Whoops," a raspy voice says.
You look up. It’s Harry Styles. He catches the tray of nuggets with one hand and catches you with the other.
"Careful, Y/N," he chuckles, his dimples deep. "These nuggets are precious. Almost as precious as you."
He picks up a nugget, dips it in honey mustard, and feeds it to you while humming What Makes You Beautiful.
"Want to go ride a tandem bike through the hallways?" he asks.
"But Harry, you have a concert in ten minutes," you say.
"The fans can wait," he says, throwing a thumbs-up to a confused Liam Payne walking past.
He grabs your hand and runs down the hall, his Chelsea boots clicking loudly. It is the best day of your life.</p>
