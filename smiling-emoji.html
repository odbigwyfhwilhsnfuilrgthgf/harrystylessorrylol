                <h3>Fetus Harry</h3>
                <p>Harry Styles during the earliest years of his career, specifically from 2010 to early 2012. This era began with his audition for The X Factor UK in 2010 when he was 16 years old 
				and continued through the release of One Direction's debut album, Up All Night. He was best known for his signature thick, curly "mop-top" hair, dimpled smile, and youthful appearance.

                <h3>Fratus Harry</h3>
				<p>During the Take Me Home album era (late 2012 - early 2013). He moved away from the Jack Wills hoodies and tracksuits toward a more sophisticated, preppy attire. Signature items included:
Fitted blazers with chinos and monochrome t-shirts.
Chelsea boots, which began replacing sneakers in his daily rotation.
Occasional beanies.
The "Haylor" Period: This timeframe included his high-profile relationship with Taylor Swift (notably their December 2012 Central Park date), which remains a major point of reference for fans identifying this specific era.<p>

                <h3>Fratboy Harry</h3>
				<p>The "Frat Boy Harry" era (2013 - 2014) marks the period when Harry Styles, then 19, transitioned to a more rugged and rebellious aesthetic. This stage is defined by a shift toward more casual, 
				"effortless" clothing and the significant growth of his tattoo collection.
				Signature items included white tank tops, backwards snapback hats, and skinny jeans. His curls began to grow longer, often 
				styled with beanies or headbands. This era saw a rapid increase in his tattoos, including iconic pieces like the butterfly on his torso and the ship on his arm. He frequently wore unbuttoned flannel shirts, 
				hockey or basketball jerseys, and Chelsea boots instead of the blazers seen in earlier years. </p>

                <h3>Prince Hair Harry (PHH)</h3>
                <p>This era occurred during One Direction's peak, (2014)  just before he transitioned to even longer shoulder-length hair.
Long, swept-back, or messy curls that resembled a classic "princely" or romantic look.

The look was often associated with wide-brimmed fedoras, black or dark denim jeans, patterned or unbuttoned shirts, and Chelsea & Wyatt Boots.</p>
