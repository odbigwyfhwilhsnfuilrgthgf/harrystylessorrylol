				<h3>Solo Audition</h3>
                <p>Harry Styles auditioned for The X Factor UK 7th season in 2010 at the age of 16. Initially, he performed "Hey, Soul Sister" by Train, however, Judge Simon Cowell stopped him mid performance, and 
				suggested that Styles should sing without any backing music. He then performed an acappella version of Stevie Wonder's "Isn't She Lovely," which showcased his vocal talent and charm.</p>

                <h3>One Direction</h3>
				<p>After being eliminated from bootcamp, judges Nicole Scherzinger, Simon Cowell, and Louis Walsh decided to create a five-member boy band from the pool of eliminated contestants.
				On 23 July 2010, Harry Styles, Liam Payne, Niall Horan, Louis Tomlinson, and Zayn Malik were chosen by Nicole Scherzinger to be put into a group. Harry Styles came up with the name One Direction (1D). 
				They went on to finish third place in the competition, gaining recognition in the UK and internationally. Their debut single "what Makes You Beautiful" won the 2012 Brit Award for Best British Single, while 
				their debut album, "Up All Night," won the title of the third best-selling album worldwide in 2012, with sales of 4.5 million copies. It became the fastest-selling debut album in the UK and topped the Billboard 
				200 in the United States, selling 176,000 copies in its first week. The album was also the first album by a group to debut at number one in the US.
